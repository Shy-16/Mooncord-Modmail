# Moonmail

Ticket manager for Mooncord

## Install Instructions

### Install latest version of Python 3.

Moonmail uses latest version of Python3, at the very least higher than 3.10.
Modmail uses poetry as dependency manager.
Install all modules:
- `poetry install`

## Install MongoDB

Moonmail uses latest version of MongoDB. 
- Configure access user with admin privileges.

By default mongoDB will create non-existing resources on first read, that means you don't need to configure anything.

## Copy config.yaml and edit it.

Copy `config.yaml` from `config_example` to root folder (where `main.py` is located).
Open it and configure the file.

## Run the bot

The bot requires discord token from a **Bot** user to run, which will be provided within the command parameters. 
To get your token create a new Application in the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and then make sure you activate the `Bot` under `Bot` configuration.

Once you have the token, run the bot:
- `poetry run python main.py -t <token>`

## Invite the bot to your server

To invite the bot to your server you have to copy both the `Applcation ID` and `Permissions` from the bot, and edit them into the invite link.

The `Application ID` can be found on top of the `General Information` of the application.

The bot uses the following permissions:
- Permissions number is: `1643630685398`
